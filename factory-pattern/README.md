# Explaintion

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

# Pros

- You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.

- Single Responsibility Principle. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.

- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.

# Cons

- The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern. The best case scenario is when you’re introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.
