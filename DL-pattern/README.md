# What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern widely used in software development to decouple dependencies between classes. In TypeScript, Dependency Injection typically involves injecting dependent objects (dependencies) into a class rather than having the class create the dependencies itself. This promotes modular, reusable, and testable code.
